Welcome to the Final Reckoning!


ABOUT THE GAME |
----------------

The Final Reckoning is a text-based story game that teaches the player the foundations of operating in a Linux command line environment and its utilities. The player will experience the narrative and have key Linux interactions taught and reinforced through the game. The gameplay takes place in a bash script that emulates the behavior of an actual Linux command line so that skills learned through play translate to Linux seamlessy.

THE LORE |
----------

You awaken from a dormant state as a paladin whose stronghold you once protected is being overrun by an army of undead demons. You and your allies fell in your previous battle against the undead, but the light which you have pledged to serve has given you a second chance to save your stronghold before it is fully destroyed. There is one issue however, from the resurrection sickness, you have forgotten your most useful skills! With this, an angel of the light known as Ludo will guide you along your journey to remember your skills and save your stronghold from the undead.

HOW TO BEGIN |
--------------

To begin playing, copy the directory known as "begin" to you terminal or prefered location.

On your command line type the following command enclosed to run the game script (do not type dollar sign): 

==========================
$ ./The_Final_Reckoning.sh
==========================

Once the script runs, you will be asked to enter your name.

Enjoy and have fun learning the fundementals of Linux!
